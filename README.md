Rock paper scissors lizard spock game

This game has been designed for users to play against the computer in a game of rock paper scissors lizard spock.  The game was given notority after being played by Dr Sheldon Cooper on the TV show Big Bang Theory and is an extension of the game Rock Paper Scissors with additional options.

As the game was given fame by the Big Bang Theory, I included a video of the character Sheldon Cooper explaining the rules of the game and also had a written version above the options for the game.

The game will give a selection for the computer and determine an outcome of a winner or a loser based on each selection.

Am I responsive shows that the site is responsive to different device sizes through utilising adaptive responsive code:

Testing:

I have tested the site across different browsers and it works successfully on Chrome & Safari I have confirmed that the site is responsive on different screen sizes using dev tools, and functions successfully I have confirmed that the usability of the site is friendly to users and is readable I have tested on lighthouse and achieved high scores across most metrics except best practices which is strange because I ran it once and the score was excellent and ran it again and the score was not.

Bugs: Solved bugs: on the W3C validator for CSS, there were unclosed functions as well as missing end of functions (;) which I have corrected.
bug found on the html in the W3C validator for not closed functions, which I have corrected
The logo was not centreing on the screen within dev tools/am i responsive, which I updated with new CSS to correct.
The video was not loading on the screen which I googled and found to change the "watch" within the url to "embed" which worked.
JS corrections on the outcomes of the game which were incorrect.

Unsolved Bugs: Performance on the lighthouse scores.  I was not sure what it actually wanted me to do

Validator testing: HTML - bug found and corrected, now no issues
CSS bug found and corrected, now no issues
Lighthouse scores - best practices is not as high as it could be - not sure why.

Deployment:

Normal deployment following testing, no issues identified during deployment using the same process as used previously.

Credits: Javascript was explained and outlined in a You Tube video called "3 ways to code a rock, paper, scissors game" which I expanded to include Lizard & Spock.  Images for options was taken from icon library/google images.  Video is from Big Bank Theory (YouTube)

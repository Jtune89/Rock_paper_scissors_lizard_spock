Rock paper scissors lizard spock game

This game has been designed for users to play against the computer in a game of rock paper scissors lizard spock.  The game was given notority after being played by Dr Sheldon Cooper on the TV show Big Bang Theory and is an extension of the game Rock Paper Scissors with additional options.

As the game was given fame by the Big Bang Theory, I included a video of the character Sheldon Cooper explaining the rules of the game and also had a written version above the options for the game.

The game will give a selection for the computer and determine an outcome of a winner or a loser based on each selection.

Bugs: Solved bugs: on the W3C validator it showed Alt tags missing for the logo which I have now resolved when I deployed the code, I realised I had not put my main HTML file name as index.html so the deployed code was showing the readme file which needed to be amended and also required code changes.

Unsolved Bugs: This W3C validator saying the footer tag should not be there - but it should so I have left it where it is Lighthouse gave a score of 83 on SEO because a meta description is missing so I added it into the code, ran it again and it said the same thing On the form I have no back end to submit the information to, I was going to steal the code institute one from the coffee house project however when you submit it, it shows code insitute and I thought it wouldn't look great so did not put an "action" into the form.

Validator testing: HTML - bug mentioned above CSS - no issues identified Lighthouse scores: 82 performance 100 accessibility 92 best practice 83 SEO

Deployment:

The walkthrough video on the sample project for deployment is out of date and I had to spend some time trying to find the section to load the branch to main. I had to do this activity a few times as mentioned with the index.html name change.

Credits: Javascript was explained and outlined in a You Tube video called "3 ways to code a rock, paper, scissors game" which I expanded to include Lizard & Spock.  Images for options was taken from icon library/google images.  Video is from Big Bank Theory (YouTube)
